          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p><strong>Hello! I'm Shrestha Ghosh, a passionate and dedicated Civil Engineer.</strong></p>

<p>
  With a degree in Civil Engineering, I have a keen interest in sustainable construction and structural integrity. 
  Over the years, I have worked on various projects ranging from residential buildings to large-scale infrastructure developments.
</p>

<p>
  I completed both my secondary and higher secondary schooling under the CBSE curriculum. 
  Following that, I pursued a diploma in Civil Engineering, which laid the foundation for my technical expertise in the field. 
  Subsequently, I enrolled in a Bachelor of Arts (Honors) program in English. However, my passion for engineering led me to 
  pursue a B.Tech in Civil Engineering at Narula Institute of Technology, where I am currently in my final year.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond academics, I have gained hands-on industry experience through an internship with Kolkata Metro, 
  where I was exposed to large-scale urban infrastructure projects and gained practical insights into metro construction and project execution.
</p>

<p>
  I specialize in project management, construction technology, and structural design. 
  My goal is to bring innovative solutions to the engineering world and contribute to making infrastructure 
  safer, more efficient, and sustainable.
